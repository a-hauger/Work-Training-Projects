# Work-Training-Projects


The following are projects created at LASP in order to assist in my programming knowledge:

1. ShakespeareRegEx:  Using python3 and regular expressions to open a file, read the contents of the file and 
        create two nested dictionaries based on the content of the file. The first part of the dictionary is the
        character's name, the second part is each unique word spoken by the character as well as the number of times
        that word was spoken.
        
2. Planets:  Using python3, create a series of classes (for each planet) that inherit from a parent class (the Planet
        class).  Then, using inheritance again, we polymorph the classes in order to give them added attributes.
        
3. Vietnam Problem:  Using python3, create a pool of processes to work in parallel to solve the 'Vietnamese Math Problem'
        and print out the number of permutations that can be used to solve the problem.
        
4. QT Form: Using PyQt5 and python3, create a MadLib! program.  The features include: saving the madlib, opening a madlib, 
        changing the theme (using stylesheets), using stacked layouts.

5. Perl Exercises:  Various scripts to learn the Perl programming language.
        * Approximate Pi - Approximates the value of pi based on user input
        * Collatz - Determines the number of iterations required to make a number (based on user input) reach one, and provides a histogram in ASCII
        * Doody Counter - Reads a file in from the command line and prints out how many times the word "Doody" (or a variety of other homophones) are used in said file
        * Find Primes - Finds the first 100 prime numbers as well as finding the first x prime numbers based on user input.
        * Image Sort - Sorts the images in a directory based on pixel size. Takes a directory in the command line.
        * Isocoles - Creates an isocoles triangle of base x based on user input.
