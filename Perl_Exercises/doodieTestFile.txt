"Johnson, why does it smell like doodie in here?!"

"Seargent, its because Peterson's dog 'Duty' made a large doody in the corner."

"Well, Johnson, who's duty is it to clean the doggy doodies?"

"Seargent, I'll look at the duty roster, but I have yet to complete my other duties!"

"That's fine Johnson, you complete your other duties, I'll assign SPC Dudey to clean the doggy doody.  Dudey is on my dudey list."

"Ha, Seargent, you said 'doodie.'"

"Johnson, while 'doody' is a funny word, it is Dudey's name.  Drop and give me 20!"
